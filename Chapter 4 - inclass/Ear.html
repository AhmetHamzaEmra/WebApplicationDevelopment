      <h2>Ear</h2>
      <img src="ear.jpg">
      <p>the organ of hearing and equilibrium in vertebrates, in humans <br />
        consisting of an external ear that gathers sound vibrations, a middle <br />
        ear in which the vibrations resonate against the tympanic membrane, and <br />
        a fluid-filled internal ear that maintains balance and that conducts the <br />
        tympanic vibrations to the auditory nerve, which transmits them as <br />
        impulses to the brain.
