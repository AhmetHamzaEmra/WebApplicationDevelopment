We ask all participants to dress appropriate for winter conditions. For safety we will not allow anyone to ride a snowmobile in jeans or sneakers. Remember passengers will be colder than drivers. </p>

	Always drive on the right hand side of the trail and park to the right in single file off the edge of a groomed surface.
	Stay on designated trails and respect landowner's property.
	NEVER drink and drive!</p>
