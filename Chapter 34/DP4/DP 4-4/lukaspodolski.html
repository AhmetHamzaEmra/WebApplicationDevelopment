	Lukas Josef Podolski  (on 4 June 1985) is a German footballer who plays as a forward for Turkish club <br />Galatasaray. He is a left-footed attacker known for his strong shot, technique and probing <br />attacks from the left side.

He joined 1. FC Köln in 1995 where he broke into the first team in 2003 and made 81 appearances for the <br />club before moving to Bayern Munich. With Bayern, Podolski won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in <br />2008. Podolski returned to 1. FC Köln in 2009. He later signed for Premier League club Arsenal in <br />2012, with whom he won the FA Cup in 2014. Having fallen out of favour with Arsenal, he moved on loan to<br /> Italian club Inter in January 2015, then permanently to Galatasaray six months after.<br />

Although he was eligible to play for Germany and Poland, Podolski chose to play for Germany. He was first <br />capped by Germany in 2004 and has been part of the squad in all major tournaments since then, winning <br />the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He is the third most-capped player in German history, with 129 caps, and <br />the third-highest goalscorer in German history, having scored 48 times.<br />

On 29 May 2013, Podolski scored the fastest goal in German national team history, after just 9 seconds of<br /> the 4–2 friendly win over Ecuador. It was at that time the second fastest international goal in <br />history, second only to San Marino's Davide Gualtieri's 8.3-second strike against England in 1993.<br /> Podolski retired from international football on 15 August 2016.	<br />
