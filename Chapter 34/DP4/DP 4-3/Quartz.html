	<p><b>Description:</b>Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, after <br/>feldspar. Its crystal structure is a continuous framework of SiO4 siliconâ€“oxygen tetrahedra, with <br/>each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2.<br/>
	<p></p>
	There are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are semi-precious gemstones. Since <br/>antiquity, varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and <br/>hardstone carvings, especially in Eurasia.
